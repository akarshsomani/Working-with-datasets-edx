# Working-with-datasets-edx

1. Dealing with raw data- Here it is shown how to tackle the raw data. Pandas is used for tackling data. Several cool functions like dropna, replace, read_html, astype, get_dummies, to_numeric, fillna, reset_index,.loc, describe, info etc are used


2. Basic and higher dimensionality visualization- Basic but powerful plots like histogram, scatter plot, 3-D plot, parallel_coordinates and andrews_curve is shown here.


3. Unsupervised learning- It contains Working with PCA(principal component analysis) and isomap to find out patterns in the dataset provided


4. supervised learning and clustering- Clustering is also an unsupervised learning type shown here. K_nearest_neighbour and Regression are supervised learning algorithms, implemented here.


5. more classifiers- SVM(support vector machine), Decision tree and Random forest are implemented here as the supervised learning algorithm.
 
 SVM -A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.
